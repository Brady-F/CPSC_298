# Lecture 4

## Housekeeping
    * Week in World of AI
        - Open AI Strawberry (o1)
        - Google Notebook LM
    * Homework and Quizzes Assesment
    * Cloud Recordings now with AI

## Review how to use Github
- Git
    * SSH Keys
    * local Forks
    * Creating branches (prefer `git checkout -b <branch>`)
    * Setting up Pull Requests
- Survey of Development Environments (Aider, Cursor, V0...)

## Coding Assistance Tools; Reproducibility & Canonical Use
- What is Open Source
    * Licenses
    * LLMs: Weights, Model, & Data
- Tooling: Aider vs. Cursor vs. V0 & Replit
- Higher Level Abstraction vs. Close to "metal" command line use
- Determinism and Higher Level Abstractions

## Current AI & LLM Technology for Coding Synthesis
- Benchmarking
- Self Taught Reasoners (STaR)
- Chain/Tree of Thought Reasoning
- Feed Forward Networks & Autoregression with Loss Minimization
- Tokenization
- Next Token Prediction
- Transformers & Attention
- Mixture of Experts (MoE) and non-Composition
- Need for Composition

## Artificial Neural Networks:
- Legacy Software Tool Chains

## Quiz
- Concepts from first four lectures 

## Previous Homework
- Everyone should have SSH keys setup along with forks
- Everyone should have placed notes on learning experience and screenshot of app in the `.md` file
- Everyone should have made a Pull Request to only your OWN repo fork - not class one.
